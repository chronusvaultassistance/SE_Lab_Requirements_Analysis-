\chapter{Introduction}
The requirement analysis report provides a comprehensive introduction to the requirements for the University Portal Management System. The system is designed as a secure, role-based web application to facilitate interactions among students, teachers, and administrators in a university setting. It addresses Vital challenges in academic management, such as manual processes, communication gaps, and lack of centralized resources. The following sections outline a brief summary of the project, user interface overview, functional requirements, project boundaries, team roles, development process model, technical processes, and non-functional requirements. This analysis ensures that the system meets user needs while adhering to modern software engineering practices, incorporating updates such as Next.js for unified frontend and backend, Prisma ORM for MySQL integration, and enhanced security features like API endpoint obfuscation.

\section{Brief Summary of the University Portal Management System}
The University Portal Management System is a web-based platform aimed at streamlining academic operations within a university environment. It supports three primary user entities: students, teachers (with sub-roles including course teachers, advisors, and department chairmen), and administrators. The system enables efficient management of course enrollments, lab report submissions, internal communications, attendance tracking, and administrative oversight.

Key problems addressed by the system include:
- \textbf{Manual Enrollment and Approvals}: Traditional methods often lead to delays, paperwork errors, and inefficiencies. The portal automates enrollment requests, allowing students to submit applications semester-wise and section-specific, with advisors approving them digitally.
- \textbf{Scattered Communication}: Students and faculty rely on disparate tools like emails or messaging apps, leading to missed updates. The system introduces an internal mailing feature where students can send messages to specific roles (e.g., course teachers or advisors), with restrictions to prevent abuse, such as limiting leave applications to five per month.
- \textbf{Attendance Management Issues}: Manual attendance tracking is prone to inaccuracies and fails to enforce policies consistently. The portal allows teachers to upload attendance data, automatically designating students with less than 50\% attendance as "Fail" and notifying them, while permitting updates for corrections.
- \textbf{Lack of Centralized Resources}: Course materials, lesson plans, and submissions are often decentralized. The system provides a unified repository for uploads and views, supporting various file formats (PDF, DOCX, LaTeX, PPT).
- \textbf{Administrative Overload}: Administrators handle everything manually, from role assignments to password management. The portal grants admins full control, including viewing decrypted student passwords for recovery purposes (with security caveats).

The motivation for this project stems from the need to digitize academic workflows, reduce administrative burdens, enhance transparency, and improve user satisfaction. By automating routine tasks, the system allows faculty to focus on teaching and students on learning, ultimately fostering a more efficient educational ecosystem. Recent updates include integration of Next.js for a responsive, server-side rendered interface, Prisma for type-safe database operations with MySQL, and security enhancements like API endpoint obfuscation to prevent exposure in browser developer tools.

\section{Summary of the User Interface}
The user interface (UI) of the University Portal Management System is designed to be intuitive, responsive, and role-specific, ensuring that each user type accesses only relevant features. Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, the UI emphasizes simplicity, accessibility, and mobile compatibility. Dashboards are customized: students see enrollment options and submission forms; teachers have tools for uploads and approvals; admins have comprehensive controls. The sidebar navigation is collapsible and responsive, adapting to screen sizes for seamless use on desktops and mobiles.

The UI incorporates modern design principles, such as clean navigation menus, real-time notifications for updates (e.g., enrollment status or low attendance alerts), and secure forms for data entry. Visual elements include progress trackers for attendance and interactive lists for course selections. This summary highlights how the UI supports functional requirements while maintaining usability, with updates incorporating Tailwind for styling and server-side rendering for security.

\section{Loop, Alternatives, and Conditional Logic}

This section describes procedural decision behavior derived from the system’s requirements using structured English control logic.

\subsection{System Decision Logic (Structured English)}

\begin{verbatim}
BEGIN SYSTEM OPERATION

IF student submits enrollment request THEN
    Validate student credentials
    IF student is active THEN
        Check course prerequisites
        IF prerequisites satisfied THEN
            Add request to advisor approval queue
        ELSE
            Reject enrollment request
            Notify student "Prerequisite not satisfied"
        END IF
    ELSE
        Reject enrollment request
        Notify student "Inactive status"
    END IF
END IF


IF attendance percentage >= 50 THEN
    Mark attendance as "Satisfactory"
    Notify student of current status
ELSE
    Mark attendance as "Fail"
    Send alert notification to student
    Send alert notification to advisor
END IF


IF number of leave applications <= 5 THEN
    Accept leave request
    Forward leave request to advisor
ELSE
    Reject leave request
    Notify student "Leave limit exceeded"
END IF


IF user role = "Teacher" THEN
    Provide access to attendance upload
    Provide access to course materials
    Provide access to messaging system

ELSE IF user role = "Advisor" THEN
    Provide access to enrollment approvals
    Provide access to batch communication

ELSE IF user role = "Admin" THEN
    Provide full system access
    Provide user management privileges
    Provide password recovery privileges
END IF

END SYSTEM OPERATION
\end{verbatim}

This logical structuring ensures that system operations follow the defined rules while handling exceptions gracefully, providing a robust and predictable behavior across all user interactions.
