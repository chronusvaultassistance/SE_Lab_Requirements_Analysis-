\section{Loop, Alternatives, and Conditional Logic}

This section describes procedural decision behavior derived from the system’s requirements using structured English control logic.

\subsection{System Decision Logic (Structured English)}

\begin{verbatim}
BEGIN SYSTEM OPERATION

IF student submits enrollment request THEN
    Validate student credentials
    IF student is active THEN
        Check course prerequisites
        IF prerequisites satisfied THEN
            Add request to advisor approval queue
        ELSE
            Reject enrollment request
            Notify student "Prerequisite not satisfied"
        END IF
    ELSE
        Reject enrollment request
        Notify student "Inactive status"
    END IF
END IF


IF attendance percentage >= 50 THEN
    Mark attendance as "Satisfactory"
    Notify student of current status
ELSE
    Mark attendance as "Fail"
    Send alert notification to student
    Send alert notification to advisor
END IF


IF number of leave applications <= 5 THEN
    Accept leave request
    Forward leave request to advisor
ELSE
    Reject leave request
    Notify student "Leave limit exceeded"
END IF


IF user role = "Teacher" THEN
    Provide access to attendance upload
    Provide access to course materials
    Provide access to messaging system

ELSE IF user role = "Advisor" THEN
    Provide access to enrollment approvals
    Provide access to batch communication

ELSE IF user role = "Admin" THEN
    Provide full system access
    Provide user management privileges
    Provide password recovery privileges
END IF

END SYSTEM OPERATION
\end{verbatim}

This logical structuring ensures that system operations follow the defined rules while handling exceptions gracefully, providing a robust and predictable behavior across all user interactions.
